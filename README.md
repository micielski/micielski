My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not  
hope for a better world for anyone.  
In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others.  
I want no one to escape.  
But even after admitting this, there is  
no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude  
me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.  
No new knowledge can be extracted from  
my telling.  
This confession has meant nothing.
